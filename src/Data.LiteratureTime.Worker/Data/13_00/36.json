    "Quote": "Steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there, tempted by the enormous\nsums of money offered by fugitives, and it is said that many who swam\nout to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks and drowned. About\none o’clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud of the\nblack vapour appeared between the arches of Blackfriars Bridge. At that\nthe Pool became a scene of mad confusion, fighting, and collision, and\nfor some time a multitude of boats and barges jammed in the northern\narch of the Tower Bridge, and the sailors and lightermen had to fight\nsavagely against the people who swarmed upon them from the riverfront.",
