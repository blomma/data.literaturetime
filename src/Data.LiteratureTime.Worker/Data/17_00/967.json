    "Quote": "Many of its first\nand second floors are let, furnished, to single gentlemen; and it\ntakes boarders besides. It is a great resort of foreigners. The\ndark-complexioned men who wear large rings, and heavy watch-guards, and\nbushy whiskers, and who congregate under the Opera Colonnade, and about\nthe box-office in the season, between four and five in the afternoon,\nwhen they give away the orders,--all live in Golden Square, or within a\nstreet of it. Two or three violins and a wind instrument from the Opera\nband reside within its precincts. Its boarding-houses are musical, and\nthe notes of pianos and harps float in the evening time round the head\nof the mournful statue, the guardian genius of a little wilderness of\nshrubs, in the centre of the square.",
