Down a long narrow\nlane we went, meeting some wanderers and some roisterers; and, as we\nrode, we heard the Cathedral bells still clanging out their welcome to\nthe King. It was half-past six, and still light. At last we came to the\ncity wall and to a gate.\n\n“Have your weapon ready,” whispered Sapt.",
