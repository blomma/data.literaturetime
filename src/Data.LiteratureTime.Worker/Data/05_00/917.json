    "Quote": "They reached, in course of time, their halting-place within ten miles of\nLondon, and lay there for the night, after bargaining to be carried on\nfor a trifle next day, in a light van which was returning empty, and was\nto start at five o’clock in the morning. The driver was punctual, the\nroad good--save for the dust, the weather being very hot and dry--and at\nseven in the forenoon of Friday the second of June, one thousand seven\nhundred and eighty, they alighted at the foot of Westminster Bridge,\nbade their conductor farewell, and stood alone, together, on the\nscorching pavement.",
