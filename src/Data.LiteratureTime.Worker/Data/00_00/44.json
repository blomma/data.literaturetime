    "Quote": "There were tired men in rumpled\nshirts, their necks bare and their suspenders down; old women with\ntheir heads tied up in black handkerchiefs; bedraggled young women who\nwent to sleep while they were nursing their babies and forgot to button\nup their dresses; dirty boys who added to the general discomfort by\ntaking off their boots. The brakeman, when he came through at midnight,\nsniffed the heavy air disdainfully and looked up at the ventilators. As\nhe glanced down the double rows of contorted figures, he saw one pair\nof eyes that were wide open and bright, a yellow head that was not\novercome by the stupefying heat and smell in the car.",
