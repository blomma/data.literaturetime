On\nthe night of the 19th the volcano of Osorno was in action.  At midnight\nthe sentry observed something like a large star, which gradually\nincreased in size till about three o'clock, when it presented a very\nmagnificent spectacle.  By the aid of a glass, dark objects, in\nconstant succession, were seen, in the midst of a great glare of red\nlight, to be thrown up and to fall down.",
