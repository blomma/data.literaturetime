    "Quote": "The ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast\nsailer and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight\nsomewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the\nforecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps—every\nsoul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death.",

    "Quote": "So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and over\nall our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a\nhope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil;\nbut if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to\ncheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we\nwould fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain!\nThis coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will\nquit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.”\n\n“There now’s the old Mogul,” soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, “he’s\nbeen twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with\nfaces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long.",
