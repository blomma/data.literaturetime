Every full\nmoon, at midnight, that voice calls, ‘Over!’ I and my varlet have more\nthan once obeyed the summons, and we have sometimes had a glimpse of a\nwhite figure under the opposite trees: but when the boat has touched the\nbank, nothing has been to be seen; and the voice has been heard no more\ntill the midnight of the next full moon.",

    "Quote": "A damsel came in midnight rain,\nAnd called across the ferry:\nThe weary wight she called in vain,\nWhose senses sleep did bury.\nAt evening, from her father’s door\nShe turned to meet her lover:\nAt midnight, on the lonely shore,\nShe shouted “Over, over!”\n\nShe had not met him by the tree\nOf their accustomed meeting,\nAnd sad and sick at heart was she,\nHer heart all wildly beating.",
