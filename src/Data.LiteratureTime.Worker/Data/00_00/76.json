They will sneak down from\nnorthards, along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go\nin the niggerâ€™s cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin\nhorn if I see any danger; but stead of that I will BA like a sheep\nsoon as they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting\nhis chains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at\nyour leasure.",
