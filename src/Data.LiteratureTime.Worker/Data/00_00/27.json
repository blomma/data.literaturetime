    "Quote": "Her way back to the house was by a path through a young plantation of\ntapering firs, which had been planted some years earlier to shelter the\npremises from the north wind. By reason of the density of the\ninterwoven foliage it was gloomy there at cloudless noontide, twilight\nin the evening, dark as midnight at dusk, and black as the ninth plague\nof Egypt at midnight. To describe the spot is to call it a vast, low,\nnaturally formed hall, the plumy ceiling of which was supported by\nslender pillars of living wood, the floor being covered with a soft dun\ncarpet of dead spikelets and mildewed cones, with a tuft of\ngrass-blades here and there.",

    "Quote": "This seemed feasible enough, for Turpin’s speeches were not many or\nlong, the fascination of the piece lying entirely in the action; and\naccordingly the play began, and at the appointed time Black Bess leapt\ninto the grassy circle amid the plaudits of the spectators. At the\nturnpike scene, where Bess and Turpin are hotly pursued at midnight by\nthe officers, and the half-awake gatekeeper in his tasselled nightcap\ndenies that any horseman has passed, Coggan uttered a broad-chested\n“Well done!” which could be heard all over the fair above the bleating,\nand Poorgrass smiled delightedly with a nice sense of dramatic contrast\nbetween our hero, who coolly leaps the gate, and halting justice in the\nform of his enemies, who must needs pull up cumbersomely and wait to be\nlet through.",
