You should\nbe back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before\nmidnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the\nfear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor\nforeseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be\npreferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have to\nask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own\nhand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to\nplace in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from\nmy cabinet.",
