    "Quote": "“They have found the little foot!” exclaimed the scout, moving\nforward, without attending further to his own portion of the duty. “What\nhave we here? An ambushment has been planted in the spot! No, by the truest\nrifle on the frontiers, here have been them one-sided horses again! Now the\nwhole secret is out, and all is plain as the north star at midnight. Yes, here\nthey have mounted. There the beasts have been bound to a sapling, in waiting;\nand yonder runs the broad path away to the north, in full sweep for the\nCanadas.",
