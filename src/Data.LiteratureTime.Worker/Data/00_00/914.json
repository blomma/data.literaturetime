    "Quote": "Therefore the skulls grin aloft horribly, thrust\nthrough and through with iron spears.  Hence, there is attraction of\nrepulsion for me in Saint Ghastly Grim, and, having often contemplated it\nin the daylight and the dark, I once felt drawn towards it in a\nthunderstorm at midnight.  ‘Why not?’ I said, in self-excuse.  ‘I have\nbeen to see the Colosseum by the light of the moon; is it worse to go to\nsee Saint Ghastly Grim by the light of the lightning?’  I repaired to the\nSaint in a hackney cab, and found the skulls most effective, having the\nair of a public execution, and seeming, as the lightning flashed, to wink\nand grin with the pain of the spikes.",

    "Quote": "She is a very gratifying experience, in\nthe simplicity and humanity of her arrangements for troops, in her\nprovision for light and air and cleanliness, and in her care for women\nand children.  It occurs to me, as I explore her, that I would require a\nhandsome sum of money to go aboard her, at midnight by the Dockyard bell,\nand stay aboard alone till morning; for surely she must be haunted by a\ncrowd of ghosts of obstinate old martinets, mournfully flapping their\ncherubic epaulettes over the changed times.  Though still we may learn\nfrom the astounding ways and means in our Yards now, more highly than\never to respect the forefathers who got to sea, and fought the sea, and\nheld the sea, without them.",
