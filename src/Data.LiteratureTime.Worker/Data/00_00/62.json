On the march Tars Tarkas,\nthrough his remarkable ability and statesmanship, enlisted fifty\nthousand more warriors from various hordes, so that, ten days after we\nset out we halted at midnight outside the great walled city of Zodanga,\none hundred and fifty thousand strong.\n\nThe fighting strength and efficiency of this horde of ferocious green\nmonsters was equivalent to ten times their number of red men.",
