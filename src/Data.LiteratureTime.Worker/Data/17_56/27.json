    "Quote": "The sun went down almost blood-red that night, and a livid cloud\nreceived its rays in the east. Up against this dark background the west\nfront of the church tower—the only part of the edifice visible from the\nfarm-house windows—rose distinct and lustrous, the vane upon the\npinnacle bristling with rays. Here, about six o’clock, the young men of\nthe village gathered, as was their custom, for a game of fives. The\ntower had been consecrated to this ancient diversion from time\nimmemorial, the western façade conveniently forming the boundary of the\nchurchyard at that end, where the ground was trodden hard and bare as a\npavement by the players.",
