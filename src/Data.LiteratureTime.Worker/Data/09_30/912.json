    "Quote": "I did not observe anything\nparticular in the aspect of the glorious planet, except that he appeared\nto me (it might have been a delusion of my heightened fancy) to shine\nwith more than common brilliancy, and to shed a refulgent lustre upon the\ntown, such as I had never observed before.  This is the more\nextraordinary, as the sky was perfectly cloudless, and the atmosphere\npeculiarly fine.  At half-past nine o’clock the general committee\nassembled, with the last year’s president in the chair.  The report of\nthe council was read; and one passage, which stated that the council had\ncorresponded with no less than three thousand five hundred and\nseventy-one persons, (all of whom paid their own postage,) on no fewer\nthan seven thousand two hundred and forty-three topics, was received with\na degree of enthusiasm which no efforts could suppress.",
