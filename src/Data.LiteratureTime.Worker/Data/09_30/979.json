    "Quote": "Curiously enough, the anchor happened to\nhook, and so discover the cable, which was thereupon grappled, cut, and\nthe sea end brought on board over the bow sheave. After being passed six\ntimes round the picking-up drum it was led into the hold, and the\nElba slowly forged ahead, hauling in the cable from the bottom as she\nproceeded. At half-past nine she anchored for the night some distance\nfrom the shore, and at three next morning resumed her picking up. 'With\na small delay for one or two improvements I had seen to be necessary\nlast night,' writes Jenkin, 'the engine started, and since that time I\ndo not think there has been half an hour's stoppage.",
