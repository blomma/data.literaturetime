    "Quote": "A boy\nfrom the town, trenching on Smith’s monopoly, was selling papers with\nthe afternoon’s news. The ringing impact of trucks, the sharp whistle\nof the engines from the junction, mingled with their shouts of “Men\nfrom Mars!” Excited men came into the station about nine o’clock with\nincredible tidings, and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might\nhave done. People rattling Londonwards peered into the darkness outside\nthe carriage windows, and saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark\ndance up from the direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil of\nsmoke driving across the stars, and thought that nothing more serious\nthan a heath fire was happening.",
