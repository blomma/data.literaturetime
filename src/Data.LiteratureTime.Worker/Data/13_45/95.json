If all went well, they would be in front of the Castle by\nabout a quarter to two. Leaving their horses half a mile off, they were\nto steal up to the entrance and hold themselves in readiness for the\nopening of the door. If the door were not opened by two, they were to\nsend Fritz von Tarlenheim round to the other side of the Castle.",
