    "Quote": "It was our good fortune to leave the _Streak_ when we did, for a little\nlater one of the spy fishermen appeared.  Charley and I took up our\naccustomed places, on the stringer-piece, a little ahead of the _Streak_\nand over our own boat, where we could comfortably watch the _Lancashire\nQueen_.  Nothing occurred till about nine o’clock, when we saw the two\nItalians leave the ship and pull along their side of the triangle toward\nthe shore.  Charley looked as unconcerned as could be, but before they\nhad covered a quarter of the distance, he whispered to me:\n\n“Forty-five miles an hour . . . nothing can save them . . . they are\nours!”",
