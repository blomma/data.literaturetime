I heard one man say it\nwas nearly three o’clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn’t wait more than\nabout a week longer. After that the talk got further and further away,\nand I couldn’t make out the words any more; but I could hear the\nmumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.",
