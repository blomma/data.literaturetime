    "Quote": "It was about six o’clock in the evening, when a vast mob poured\ninto Lincoln’s Inn Fields by every avenue, and divided--evidently in\npursuance of a previous design--into several parties. It must not be\nunderstood that this arrangement was known to the whole crowd, but that\nit was the work of a few leaders; who, mingling with the men as they\ncame upon the ground, and calling to them to fall into this or that\nparry, effected it as rapidly as if it had been determined on by a\ncouncil of the whole number, and every man had known his place.",
