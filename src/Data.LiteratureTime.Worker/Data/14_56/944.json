At midnight\nthe sentry observed something like a large star, which gradually\nincreased in size till about three o'clock, when it presented a very\nmagnificent spectacle.  By the aid of a glass, dark objects, in\nconstant succession, were seen, in the midst of a great glare of red\nlight, to be thrown up and to fall down.",

The evening\nwas calm and bright, and we enjoyed a fine view of the surrounding\nisles.  Cape Horn, however, demanded his tribute, and before night sent\nus a gale of wind directly in our teeth.",
