    "Quote": "About half-past nine or ten oâ€™clock he came along the deserted street to\nwhere the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon\nhis listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain\nof a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the\nfence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under\nthat window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him\ndown on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his\nhands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower.",
