As it would pass the corner of the lane at about six o’clock in\nthe morning, Mr Pecksniff requested that the gig might be in waiting at\nthe finger-post about that time, together with a cart for the luggage.\nAnd to the end that he might be received with the greater honour, the\nyoung men agreed to rise early, and be upon the spot themselves.",
