    "Quote": "It was but\na small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson’s Island beyond\neye-shot of the village, and so he “looked his last” with a broken and\nsatisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and\nthey all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift\nthem out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in\ntime, and made shift to avert it. About two o’clock in the morning the\nraft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,\nand they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part\nof the little raft’s belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they\nspread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions;\nbut they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as\nbecame outlaws.",

    "Quote": "A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been\nrecognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter—so the story ran. And\nit was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself\nin the “branch” about one or two o’clock in the morning, and that Potter\nhad at once sneaked off—suspicious circumstances, especially the washing\nwhich was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town had\nbeen ransacked for this “murderer” (the public are not slow in the\nmatter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he\ncould not be found.",
