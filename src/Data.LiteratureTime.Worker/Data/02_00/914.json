As the Amazon\nwas to sail with the next tide, and as it would not be high water before\ntwo o’clock in the morning, I left her with her tea in full action, and\nher idle Steam Tug lying by, deputing steam and smoke for the time being\nto the Tea-kettles.\n\nI afterwards learned that a Despatch was sent home by the captain before\nhe struck out into the wide Atlantic, highly extolling the behaviour of\nthese Emigrants, and the perfect order and propriety of all their social\narrangements.",

A sullen solitary light is pointed out to me in the black sky\nyonder.  A change is expected in the light, but none takes place.",
