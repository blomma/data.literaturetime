    "Quote": "It grew upon her ear, while she remembered\nclearly that the clock on the wall was silent, had no audible tick.  What\ndid it mean by beginning to tick so loudly all of a sudden?  Its face\nindicated ten minutes to nine.  Mrs Verloc cared nothing for time, and\nthe ticking went on.  She concluded it could not be the clock, and her\nsullen gaze moved along the walls, wavered, and became vague, while she\nstrained her hearing to locate the sound.  Tic, tic, tic.\n\nAfter listening for some time Mrs Verloc lowered her gaze deliberately on\nher husbandâ€™s body.",
