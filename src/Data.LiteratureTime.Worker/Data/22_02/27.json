It was on the north side of the tower, screened to a great\nextent from the view of passers along the road—a spot which until\nlately had been abandoned to heaps of stones and bushes of alder, but\nnow it was cleared and made orderly for interments, by reason of the\nrapid filling of the ground elsewhere.",
