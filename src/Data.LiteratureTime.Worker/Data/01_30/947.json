    "Quote": "At eleven o'clock the boats, containing between 600 and 700 men,\nwith 180 on board the FOX cutter, and from 70 to 80 in a boat which had\nbeen taken the day before, proceeded in six divisions toward the town,\nconducted by all the captains of the squadron, except Freemantle and\nBowen, who attended with Nelson to regulate and lead the way to the\nattack. They were to land on the mole, and thence hasten as fast as\npossible into the great square; then form and proceed as should be found\nexpedient. They were not discovered till about half-past one o'clock,\nwhen, being within half gun-shot of the landing-place, Nelson directed\nthe boats to cast off from each other, give a huzza, and push for the\nshore. But the Spaniards were exceedingly well prepared; the alarm-bells\nanswered the huzza, and a fire of thirty or forty pieces of cannon,\nwith musketry from one end of the town to the other, opened upon the\ninvaders.",
