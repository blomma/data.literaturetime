    "Quote": "“Well, it was this way,” returned Mr. Enfield: “I was coming home from\nsome place at the end of the world, about three o’clock of a black\nwinter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was\nliterally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the\nfolks asleep—street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession\nand all as empty as a church—till at last I got into that state of mind\nwhen a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a\npoliceman.",
