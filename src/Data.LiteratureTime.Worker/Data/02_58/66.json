    "Quote": "Takis: \"And foot capacity effect as well!  When I approached my\nknee to the metal leg of the work-bench I would lose the station I had\nbeen listening to.\" He said the tuning capacitor he had made was\nobviously too small and he had to alter the taps on the coil\ncontinuously.  About three o'clock in the morning during a cold winter\nnight he heard a new sound--the breathing (carrier) noise and a sort\nof regular ticking. He later found out that it was the new\nbroadcasting station in Vienna, Austria, which transmitted the sound\nof a metronome throughout the night. This would have been about 1926.",
