    "Quote": "Lady Hamilton, like a heroine of modern romance,\nexplored with no little danger a subterraneous passage leading from the\npalace to the sea-side: through this passage the royal treasures, the\nchoicest pieces of painting and sculpture, and other property to the\namount of two millions and a half, were conveyed to the shore, and\nstowed safely on board the English ships. On the night of the 21st,\nat half-past eight, Nelson landed, brought out the whole royal family,\nembarked them in three barges, and carried them safely, through a\ntremendous sea, to the VANGUARD. Notice was then immediately given to\nthe British merchants, that they would be received on board any ships in\nthe squadron. Their property had previously been embarked in transports.",
