Charles’s Wain was getting\ntowards a right angle with the Pole star, and Gabriel concluded that it\nmust be about nine o’clock—in other words, that he had slept two hours.",

    "Quote": "The great mass of sheep in the fair consisted of South Downs and the\nold Wessex horned breeds; to the latter class Bathsheba’s and Farmer\nBoldwood’s mainly belonged. These filed in about nine o’clock, their\nvermiculated horns lopping gracefully on each side of their cheeks in\ngeometrically perfect spirals, a small pink and white ear nestling\nunder each horn. Before and behind came other varieties, perfect\nleopards as to the full rich substance of their coats, and only lacking\nthe spots.",
