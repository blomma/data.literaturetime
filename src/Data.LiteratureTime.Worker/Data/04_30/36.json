About half past four I went up to the\nrailway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers had\ncontained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent,\nHenderson, Ogilvy, and the others. But there was little I didnâ€™t know.\nThe Martians did not show an inch of themselves.",
