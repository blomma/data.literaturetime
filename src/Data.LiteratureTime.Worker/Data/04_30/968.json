    "Quote": "Half-past nine, you know. Let us say from half-past nine to four, or\nhalf-past four, or thereabouts; one day, perhaps, a little earlier,\nanother day, perhaps, a little later, according as you feel disposed,\nand as you arrange your work. Mr Fips, Austin Friars of course you’ll\nremember? And you won’t forget to slam the door, if you please!’\n\nHe said all this in such a comfortable, easy manner, that Tom could only\nrub his hands, and nod his head, and smile in acquiescence which he was\nstill doing, when Mr Fips walked coolly out.",

    "Quote": "They were not quite so glad to get up again at half-past four o’clock,\nin all the shivering discomfort of a dark winter’s morning; but they\nturned out punctually, and were at the finger-post full half-an-hour\nbefore the appointed time. It was not by any means a lively morning, for\nthe sky was black and cloudy, and it rained hard; but Martin said there\nwas some satisfaction in seeing that brute of a horse (by this, he meant\nMr Pecksniff’s Arab steed) getting very wet; and that he rejoiced, on\nhis account, that it rained so fast.",
