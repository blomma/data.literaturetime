    "Quote": "I suppose it was nearly eleven o’clock before we gathered courage to\nstart again, no longer venturing into the road, but sneaking along\nhedgerows and through plantations, and watching keenly through the\ndarkness, he on the right and I on the left, for the Martians, who\nseemed to be all about us. In one place we blundered upon a scorched\nand blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scattered\ndead bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks but with\ntheir legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses, fifty feet,\nperhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages.",
