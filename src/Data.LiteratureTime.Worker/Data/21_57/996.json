    "Quote": "Night came and they went home, and there was a ladies’ dancing party,\nfor Don Antonio’s wife, a lady of rank and gaiety, beauty and wit, had\ninvited some friends of hers to come and do honour to her guest and\namuse themselves with his strange delusions. Several of them came, they\nsupped sumptuously, the dance began at about ten o’clock. Among the\nladies were two of a mischievous and frolicsome turn, and, though\nperfectly modest, somewhat free in playing tricks for harmless\ndiversion’s sake. These two were so indefatigable in taking Don Quixote\nout to dance that they tired him down, not only in body but in spirit.",
