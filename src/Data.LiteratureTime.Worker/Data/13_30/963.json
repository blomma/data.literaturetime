    "Quote": "Meanwhile Flora was murmuring in rapid snatches for his ear, that there\nwas a time and that the past was a yawning gulf however and that a\ngolden chain no longer bound him and that she revered the memory of the\nlate Mr F. and that she should be at home to-morrow at half-past one\nand that the decrees of Fate were beyond recall and that she considered\nnothing so improbable as that he ever walked on the north-west side of\nGray’s-Inn Gardens at exactly four o’clock in the afternoon. He tried\nat parting to give his hand in frankness to the existing Flora--not the\nvanished Flora, or the mermaid--but Flora wouldn’t have it, couldn’t\nhave it, was wholly destitute of the power of separating herself and him\nfrom their bygone characters.",

    "Quote": "The store of creature comforts was not the chief part of the visitor’s\nreception. Its special feature was a foregone family confidence and\nsympathy. When Young John appeared at half-past one without the ivory\nhand and waistcoat of golden sprigs, the sun shorn of his beams by\ndisastrous clouds, Mr Pancks presented him to the yellow-haired Ruggs as\nthe young man he had so often mentioned who loved Miss Dorrit.\n\n‘I am glad,’ said Mr Rugg, challenging him specially in that character,\n‘to have the distinguished gratification of making your acquaintance,\nsir. Your feelings do you honour.",
