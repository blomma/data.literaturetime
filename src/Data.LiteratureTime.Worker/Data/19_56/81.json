There he found that he would\nhave a two days’ wait before he could catch a ship bound for Cape Town.\nHe occupied his time in writing out a full report of his mission. The\nsecret papers he had taken from Rokoff he did not inclose, for he did\nnot dare trust them out of his own possession until he had been\nauthorized to turn them over to another agent, or himself return to\nParis with them.",
