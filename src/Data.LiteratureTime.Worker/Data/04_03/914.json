My compatriot and I had gone on\nto Paris; my compatriot enlightening me occasionally with a long list of\nthe enormous grievances of French railway travelling: every one of which,\nas I am a sinner, was perfectly new to me, though I have as much\nexperience of French railways as most uncommercials.",
