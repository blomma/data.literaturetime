I, starting after Sapt, took a\nshorter route, skirting the town to the left, and found myself in the\noutskirts of the forest at about half-past twelve. I tied my horse up\nin a thick clump of trees, leaving the revolver in its pocket in the\nsaddle--it would be no use to me--and, ladder in hand, made my way to\nthe edge of the moat. Here I unwound my rope from about my waist, bound\nit securely round the trunk of a tree on the bank, and let myself down.",
