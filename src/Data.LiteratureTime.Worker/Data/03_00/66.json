    "Quote": "One year earlier, in 1940, following the invasion of Greece by the\nItalian army operating from Albania, the broadcasting authority in\nAthens (ETHNIKON IDRIMA RADIOFONIAS) began a news service in English\nwhich was beamed to England and the U.S.A.  on the short waves. In my\ncapacity as a member of the Press Department staff of the British\nEmbassy I took part in the first programme, and in fact read the first\nnews bulletin, which went out at 3 a.m.  Athens time.  As I said\nabove, early in April I was transferred to the British Embassy in\nCairo, Egypt.\n\n1941: Very small contingents of the British army landed in Greece\nto help the Greek army.",

When I approached my\nknee to the metal leg of the work-bench I would lose the station I had\nbeen listening to.\" He said the tuning capacitor he had made was\nobviously too small and he had to alter the taps on the coil\ncontinuously.  About three o'clock in the morning during a cold winter\nnight he heard a new sound--the breathing (carrier) noise and a sort\nof regular ticking. He later found out that it was the new\nbroadcasting station in Vienna, Austria, which transmitted the sound\nof a metronome throughout the night. This would have been about 1926.",
