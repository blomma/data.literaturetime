    "Quote": "At last, at three in the morning, when the cold light of dawning day\nbegan to steal in, I was in my dressing-room, and Sapt alone was with\nme. I sat like a man dazed, staring into the fire; he puffed at his\npipe; Fritz was gone to bed, having almost refused to speak to me. On\nthe table by me lay a rose; it had been in Flaviaâ€™s dress, and, as we\nparted, she had kissed it and given it to me.\n\nSapt advanced his hand towards the rose, but, with a quick movement, I\nshut mine down upon it.",
