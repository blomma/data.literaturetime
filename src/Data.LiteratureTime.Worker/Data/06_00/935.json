Though\nhis hours of labour were very long—often from six in the morning until\neight at night—his father contrived to give him some little teaching\nafter working hours; and it was thus that he partially learned his\nletters.  An incident occurred in the course of his employment among the\nboiler-makers, which first awakened in him the desire to learn drawing.",
