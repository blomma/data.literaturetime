As early as six o’clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping\nthrough its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over\nmeasures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best\nof times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that\nhe sold at this time.",
