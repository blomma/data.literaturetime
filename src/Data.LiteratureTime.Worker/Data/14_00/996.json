Don Quixote said that even if it reached to the bottomless\npit he meant to see where it went to; so they bought about a hundred\nfathoms of rope, and next day at two in the afternoon they arrived at\nthe cave, the mouth of which is spacious and wide, but full of thorn\nand wild-fig bushes and brambles and briars, so thick and matted that\nthey completely close it up and cover it over.\n\nOn coming within sight of it the cousin, Sancho, and Don Quixote\ndismounted, and the first two immediately tied the latter very firmly\nwith the ropes, and as they were girding and swathing him Sancho said\nto him, “Mind what you are about, master mine; don’t go burying",
