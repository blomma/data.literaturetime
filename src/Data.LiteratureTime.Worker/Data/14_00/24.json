    "Quote": "The main street was a deeply\nrutted road, now frozen hard, which ran from the squat red railway\nstation and the grain “elevator” at the north end of the town to the\nlumber yard and the horse pond at the south end. On either side of this\nroad straggled two uneven rows of wooden buildings; the general\nmerchandise stores, the two banks, the drug store, the feed store, the\nsaloon, the post-office. The board sidewalks were gray with trampled\nsnow, but at two o’clock in the afternoon the shopkeepers, having come\nback from dinner, were keeping well behind their frosty windows. The\nchildren were all in school, and there was nobody abroad in the streets\nbut a few rough-looking countrymen in coarse overcoats, with their long\ncaps pulled down to their noses.",
