I judged that that piece of paper meant that\nMiss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off;\nand I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the\ncurious way she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and\nthis awful mess wouldn’t ever happened.\n\nWhen I got down out of the tree, I crept along down the river bank a\npiece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and\ntugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces,\nand got away as quick as I could.",
