    "Quote": "By half-past two the action had ceased along that part of the line which\nwas astern of the ELEPHANT, but not with the ships ahead and the Crown\nBatteries. Nelson, seeing the manner in which his boats were fired upon\nwhen they went to take possession of the prizes, became angry, and said\nhe must either send ashore to have this irregular proceeding stopped,\nor send a fire-ship and burn them.",
