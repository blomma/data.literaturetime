Till nearly half-past two Sapt waited; then,\nfollowing my orders, he had sent Fritz to search the banks of the moat.\nI was not there.",

Yet the laugh told me that\nmy men had not come; for they must have shot Rupert ere now, if they had\ncome. And the clock struck half-past two! My God! The door had not been\nopened! They had gone to the bank! They had not found me! They had gone\nby now back to Tarlenheim, with the news of the Kingâ€™s death--and mine.\nWell, it would be true before they got there.",
