    "Quote": "The fog thickened, and Captain Lutwidge\nand his officers became exceedingly alarmed for their safety. Between\nthree and four in the morning the weather cleared, and the two\nadventurers were seen, at a considerable distance from the ship,\nattacking a huge bear. The signal for them to return was immediately\nmade; Nelson's comrade called upon him to obey it, but in vain; his\nmusket had flashed in the pan; their ammunition was expended; and a\nchasm in the ice, which divided him from the bear, probably preserved\nhis life.",
