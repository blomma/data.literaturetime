    "Quote": "Little dreaming of the jealous hatred of his neighbour, Van Baerle\nhad proceeded step by step towards gaining the prize offered by the\nHorticultural Society of Haarlem. He had progressed from hazel-nut shade\nto that of roasted coffee, and on the very day when the frightful events\ntook place at the Hague which we have related in the preceding chapters,\nwe find him, about one o’clock in the day, gathering from the border the\nyoung suckers raised from tulips of the colour of roasted coffee; and\nwhich, being expected to flower for the first time in the spring of\n1675, would undoubtedly produce the large black tulip required by the\nHaarlem Society.",
