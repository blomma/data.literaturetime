When we was three-quarters of a mile below we\nhoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o’clock it come on to rain\nand blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us\nto both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the\nduke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night. It was my\nwatch below till twelve, but I wouldn’t a turned in anyway if I’d had a\nbed, because a body don’t see such a storm as that every day in the\nweek, not by a long sight.",
