By the prodigious light of this\nconflagration, the situation of the two fleets could now be perceived,\nthe colours of both being clearly distinguishable. About ten o'clock the\nship blew up, with a shock which was felt to the very bottom of every\nvessel. Many of her officers and men jumped overboard, some clinging\nto the spars and pieces of wreck with which the sea was strewn, others\nswimming to escape from the destruction which they momently dreaded.",
