The sun not\nrising before half-past five, the night perspective looked sufficiently\nlong at half-past twelve: which was about my time for confronting it.\n\nThe restlessness of a great city, and the way in which it tumbles and\ntosses before it can get to sleep, formed one of the first entertainments\noffered to the contemplation of us houseless people.",
