    "Quote": "Mr Willet sat in what had been his accustomed place five years before,\nwith his eyes on the eternal boiler; and had sat there since the clock\nstruck eight, giving no other signs of life than breathing with a loud\nand constant snore (though he was wide awake), and from time to time\nputting his glass to his lips, or knocking the ashes out of his pipe,\nand filling it anew. It was now half-past ten. Mr Cobb and long Phil\nParkes were his companions, as of old, and for two mortal hours and a\nhalf, none of the company had pronounced one word.\n\nWhether people, by dint of sitting together in the same place and the\nsame relative positions, and doing exactly the same things for a great\nmany years, acquire a sixth sense, or some unknown power of influencing\neach other which serves them in its stead, is a question for philosophy\nto settle.",
