    "Quote": "We were to make for Chigwell in four glass coaches, each with a trifling\ncompany of six or eight inside, and a little boy belonging to the\nprojectors on the boxâ€”and to start from the residence of the projectors,\nWoburn-place, Russell-square, at half-past ten precisely.  We arrived at\nthe place of rendezvous at the appointed time, and found the glass\ncoaches and the little boys quite ready, and divers young ladies and\nyoung gentlemen looking anxiously over the breakfast-parlour blinds, who\nappeared by no means so much gratified by our approach as we might have\nexpected, but evidently wished we had been somebody else.",
