When he can get to\nit--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he might see you\nin the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can\nshow you. But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even\nif you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.",
