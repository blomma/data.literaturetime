    "Quote": "Sancho pushed on into the glens of the Sierra, leaving them in one\nthrough which there flowed a little gentle rivulet, and where the rocks\nand trees afforded a cool and grateful shade. It was an August day with\nall the heat of one, and the heat in those parts is intense, and the\nhour was three in the afternoon, all which made the spot the more\ninviting and tempted them to wait there for Sancho’s return, which they\ndid. They were reposing, then, in the shade, when a voice unaccompanied\nby the notes of any instrument, but sweet and pleasing in its tone,\nreached their ears, at which they were not a little astonished, as the\nplace did not seem to them likely quarters for one who sang so well;\nfor though it is often said that shepherds of rare voice are to be\nfound in the woods and fields, this is rather a flight of the poet’s\nfancy than the truth.",
