    "Quote": "A composite feeling, made up of\ndisgust with the, to him, humdrum tedium of a farmer’s life, gloomily\nimages of her who lay in the churchyard, remorse, and a general\naversion to his wife’s society, impelled him to seek a home in any\nplace on earth save Weatherbury. The sad accessories of Fanny’s end\nconfronted him as vivid pictures which threatened to be indelible, and\nmade life in Bathsheba’s house intolerable. At three in the afternoon\nhe found himself at the foot of a slope more than a mile in length,\nwhich ran to the ridge of a range of hills lying parallel with the\nshore, and forming a monotonous barrier between the basin of cultivated\ncountry inland and the wilder scenery of the coast.",
