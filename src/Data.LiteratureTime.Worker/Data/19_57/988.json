    "Quote": "But all spiritual, mental, and bodily\nprotective rules make the child now indirectly selfish, because\neverything centres about him and therefore he is kept in a constant\nstate of irritation. The six-yearold can disturb the conversation of the\nadult, but the twelve-year-old is sent to bed about eight o'clock, even\nwhen he, with wide open eyes, longs for a conversation that might be to\nhim an inspiring stimulus for life.\n\nCertainly some simple habits so far as conduct and order, nourishment\nand sleep, air and water, clothing and bodily movement, are concerned,\ncan be made the foundations for the child's conceptions of morality.",
