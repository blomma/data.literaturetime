    "Quote": "They had a room at one end of their drawing-room suite, nearly\nall irregular bay-window, projecting over the street, and commanding\nall the picturesque life and variety of the Corso, both up and down. At\nthree or four o’clock in the afternoon, English time, the view from this\nwindow was very bright and peculiar; and Little Dorrit used to sit\nand muse here, much as she had been used to while away the time in her\nbalcony at Venice. Seated thus one day, she was softly touched on the\nshoulder, and Fanny said, ‘Well, Amy dear,’ and took her seat at her\nside.",

    "Quote": "Meanwhile Flora was murmuring in rapid snatches for his ear, that there\nwas a time and that the past was a yawning gulf however and that a\ngolden chain no longer bound him and that she revered the memory of the\nlate Mr F. and that she should be at home to-morrow at half-past one\nand that the decrees of Fate were beyond recall and that she considered\nnothing so improbable as that he ever walked on the north-west side of\nGray’s-Inn Gardens at exactly four o’clock in the afternoon. He tried\nat parting to give his hand in frankness to the existing Flora--not the\nvanished Flora, or the mermaid--but Flora wouldn’t have it, couldn’t\nhave it, was wholly destitute of the power of separating herself and him\nfrom their bygone characters.",
