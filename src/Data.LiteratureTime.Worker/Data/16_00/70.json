    "Quote": "I have searched\nthrough several bushels of photographs of the Jungfrau here, but found\nonly one with the Face in it, and in this case it was not strictly\nrecognizable as a face, which was evidence that the picture was taken\nbefore four o’clock in the afternoon, and also evidence that all the\nphotographers have persistently overlooked one of the most fascinating\nfeatures of the Jungfrau show. I say fascinating, because if you once\ndetect a human face produced on a great plan by unconscious nature, you\nnever get tired of watching it. At first you can’t make another person\nsee it at all, but after he has made it out once he can’t see anything\nelse afterward.",

    "Quote": "—They keep two teams of singers in stock for the chief roles,\nand one of these is composed of the most renowned artists in the world,\nwith Materna and Alvary in the lead. I suppose a double team is\nnecessary; doubtless a single team would die of exhaustion in a week,\nfor all the plays last from four in the afternoon till ten at night.",
