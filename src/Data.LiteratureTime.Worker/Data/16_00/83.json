No one thought\nof eating or drinking, and at four P.M. there were vast numbers of\nspectators who had not even taken their customary lunch! And, a still\nmore significant fact, even the national passion for play seemed\nquelled for the time under the general excitement of the hour.\n\nUp till nightfall, a dull, noiseless agitation, such as precedes great\ncatastrophes, ran through the anxious multitude.",
