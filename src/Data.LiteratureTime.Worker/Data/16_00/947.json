At\nfour in the afternoon, Captain Hood, in the ZEALOUS, made the signal\nfor the enemy's fleet. For many preceding days Nelson had hardly taken\neither sleep or food: he now ordered his dinner to be served, while\npreparations were making for battle; and when his officers rose from\ntable, and went to their separate stations, he said to them, \"Before\nthis time to-morrow I shall have gained a peerage or Westminster Abbey.",
