One day, we are told, a discovery was made at 4 P.M.,\nand Edison telegraphed it to his patent agent, who immediately drew up\nthe specification, and at nine o'clock next morning cabled it to London.\nBefore the inventor was out of bed, he received an intimation that\nhis patent had been already deposited in the British Patent Office.",
