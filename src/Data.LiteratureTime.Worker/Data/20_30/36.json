There were\nthree policemen too, one of whom was mounted, doing their best, under\ninstructions from Stent, to keep the people back and deter them from\napproaching the cylinder.",

    "Quote": "I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap, pounded\ninto the road by the wheels of subsequent carts. We crossed Richmond\nBridge about half past eight. We hurried across the exposed bridge, of\ncourse, but I noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses,\nsome many feet across. I did not know what these were—there was no time\nfor scrutiny—and I put a more horrible interpretation on them than they\ndeserved.",
