    "Quote": "The rapid development of the telegraph in Europe may be gathered\nfrom the fact that in 1855, the death of the Emperor Nicholas at St.\nPetersburg, about one o'clock in the afternoon, was announced in the\nHouse of Lords a few hours later; and as a striking proof of its further\nprogress, it may be mentioned that the result of the Oaks of 1890\nwas received in New York fifteen seconds after the horses passed the\nwinning-post.",
