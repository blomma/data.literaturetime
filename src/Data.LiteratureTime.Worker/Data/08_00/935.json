    "Quote": "My education was that which is supplied at the humble\nparish schools of Scotland; and it was only when I went to Edinburgh, a\npoor boy, that I devoted my evenings, after the labours of the day, to\nthe cultivation of that intellect which the Almighty has given me.  From\nseven or eight in the morning till nine or ten at night was I at my\nbusiness as a booksellerâ€™s apprentice, and it was only during hours after\nthese, stolen from sleep, that I could devote myself to study.  I did not\nread novels: my attention was devoted to physical science, and other\nuseful matters.  I also taught myself French.",
