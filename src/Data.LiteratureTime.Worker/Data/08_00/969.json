    "Quote": "It was now near eight o’clock in the morning, for my candle had expired\nin the midst of my perusal, leaving me no alternative but to get\nanother, at the expense of alarming the house, or to go to bed, and\nwait the return of daylight. On my mother’s account, I chose the\nlatter; but how _willingly_ I sought my pillow, and how much sleep it\nbrought me, I leave you to imagine.",
