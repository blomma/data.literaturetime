    "Quote": "The wine flowed freely, as indeed\nit had done all day. Sir Mulberry drank to recompense himself for his\nrecent abstinence; the young lord, to drown his indignation; and the\nremainder of the party, because the wine was of the best and they had\nnothing to pay. It was nearly midnight when they rushed out, wild,\nburning with wine, their blood boiling, and their brains on fire, to the\ngaming-table.\n\nHere, they encountered another party, mad like themselves.",
