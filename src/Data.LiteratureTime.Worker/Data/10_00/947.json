On the 1st of August, about 10 in the morning,\nthey came in sight of Alexandria: the port had been vacant and solitary\nwhen they saw it last; it was now crowded with ships; and they perceived\nwith exultation that the tri-coloured flag was flying upon the walls. At\nfour in the afternoon, Captain Hood, in the ZEALOUS, made the signal\nfor the enemy's fleet.",
