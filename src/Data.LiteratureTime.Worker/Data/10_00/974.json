It\nwas unusually early for him; his whole person exhaled the charm of almost\ndewy freshness; he wore his blue cloth overcoat unbuttoned; his boots\nwere shiny; his cheeks, freshly shaven, had a sort of gloss; and even his\nheavy-lidded eyes, refreshed by a night of peaceful slumber, sent out\nglances of comparative alertness.",
