But\ngive me your hand, señora; I require no better protection than my own\ncontinence, and my own sense of propriety; as well as that which is\ninspired by that venerable head-dress;” and so saying he kissed her\nright hand and took it in his own, she yielding it to him with equal\nceremoniousness.",
