The work was simple,\nrequiring strength rather than intellect; yet, to one entirely unused\nto such work, it came very hard. About three o’clock of that day, I\nbroke down; my strength failed me; I was seized with a violent aching\nof the head, attended with extreme dizziness; I trembled in every limb.\nFinding what was coming, I nerved myself up, feeling it would never do\nto stop work.",
