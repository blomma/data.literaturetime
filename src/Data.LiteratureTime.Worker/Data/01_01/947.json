    "Quote": "The King's Channel, where there is deep water, is between this shoal and\nthe town; and here the Danes had arranged their line of defence, as near\nthe shore as possible: nineteen ships and floating batteries, flanked,\nat the end nearest the town, by the Crown Batteries, which were two\nartificial islands, at the mouth of the harbour--most formidable works;\nthe larger one having, by the Danish account, 66 guns; but, as Nelson\nbelieved, 88. The fleet having anchored, Nelson, with Riou, in the\nAMAZON, made his last examination of the ground; and about one o'clock,\nreturning to his own ship, threw out the signal to weigh. It was\nreceived with a shout throughout the whole division; they weighed with\na light and favourable wind: the narrow channel between the island of\nSaltholm and the Middle Ground had been accurately buoyed; the small\ncraft pointed out the course distinctly; Riou led the way: the whole\ndivision coasted along the outer edge of the shoal, doubled its further\nextremity, and anchored there off Draco Point, just as the darkness\nclosed--the headmost of the enemy's line not being more than two miles",
