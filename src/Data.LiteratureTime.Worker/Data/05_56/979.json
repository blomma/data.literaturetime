    "Quote": "The Agamemnon made an equally successful run. About six o'clock on the\nfirst evening a huge whale was seen approaching on the starboard bow,\nand as he sported in the waves, rolling and lashing them into foam,\nthe onlookers began to fear that he might endanger the line. Their\nexcitement became intense as the monster heaved astern, nearer and\nnearer to the cable, until his body grazed it where it sank into the\nwater; but happily no harm was done.",
