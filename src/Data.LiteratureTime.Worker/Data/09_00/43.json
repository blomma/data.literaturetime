    "Quote": "It was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the\nseason. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the\nwind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so\nthat as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a\nmarvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be\ndark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich,\nlurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here,\nfor a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of\ndaylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths.",
