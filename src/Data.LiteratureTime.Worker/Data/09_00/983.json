Immediately the cannon from St. Mary’s fired upon them,\nand put some troops of horse into confusion, doing great execution,\nwhich, they not being able to shun it, made them quicken their pace, fall\non, when our cannon were obliged to cease firing, lest we should hurt our\nown troops as well as the enemy.",
