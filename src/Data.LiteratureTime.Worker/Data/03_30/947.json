The night was so tempestuous that it\nwas impossible for any signal either to be seen or heard; and Nelson\ndetermined, as soon as it should be daybreak, to wear, and scud before\nthe gale; but at half-past three the fore-mast went in three pieces, and\nthe bowsprit was found to be sprung in three places.\n\nWhen day broke they succeeded in wearing the ship with a remnant of the\nspritsail. This was hardly to have been expected.",
