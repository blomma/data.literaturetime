    "Quote": "To a person who had formerly known them, it possibly might have\nbeen still more impressive; for the ruins were so mingled together, and\nthe whole scene possessed so little the air of a habitable place, that\nit was scarcely possible to imagine its former condition. The\nearthquake commenced at half-past eleven o'clock in the forenoon.  If\nit had happened in the middle of the night, the greater number of the\ninhabitants (which in this one province must amount to many thousands)\nmust have perished, instead of less than a hundred: as it was, the\ninvariable practice of running out of doors at the first trembling of\nthe ground, alone saved them.",
