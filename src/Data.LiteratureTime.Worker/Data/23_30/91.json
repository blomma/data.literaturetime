Now I noticed the time yesterday evening when the\nsun went down, and it was half-past five o’clock by the Grinnage clock,\nand half past 11 A.M. by my watch and the other clock. You see, the sun\nrose and set by my watch in St. Louis, and the Grinnage clock was six\nhours fast; but we’ve come so far east that it comes within less than\nhalf an hour of setting by the Grinnage clock now, and I’m away\nout—more than four hours and a half out.",
