    "Quote": "With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I\ncollected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a\nspark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was\nalready one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the\npanes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the\nhalf-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature\nopen; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\n\nHow can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate\nthe wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to\nform? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as\nbeautiful.",
