    "Quote": "But before she began to roll out the paste she had taken a deadly poison\nof a most awful character, distilled from toads’ eyes and spiders’ knees;\nand Captain Murderer had hardly picked her last bone, when he began to\nswell, and to turn blue, and to be all over spots, and to scream.  And he\nwent on swelling and turning bluer, and being more all over spots and\nscreaming, until he reached from floor to ceiling and from wall to wall;\nand then, at one o’clock in the morning, he blew up with a loud\nexplosion.  At the sound of it, all the milk-white horses in the stables\nbroke their halters and went mad, and then they galloped over everybody\nin Captain Murderer’s house (beginning with the family blacksmith who had\nfiled his teeth) until the whole were dead, and then they galloped away.",
