    "Quote": "This was on the 14th of October; during the five\nfollowing days the work of embarkation was carried on, the private\nproperty was saved, and public stores to the amount of L200,000. The\nFrench, favoured by the Spanish fleet, which was at that time within\ntwelve leagues of Bastia, pushed over troops from Leghorn, who landed\nnear Cape Corse on the 18th; and on the 20th, at one in the morning,\nentered the citadel, an hour only after the British had spiked the guns\nand evacuated it. Nelson embarked at daybreak, being the last person who\nleft the shore; having thus, as he said, seen the first and the last\nof Corsica.",
