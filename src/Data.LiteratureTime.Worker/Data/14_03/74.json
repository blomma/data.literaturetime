    "Quote": "It was but\na small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson’s Island beyond\neye-shot of the village, and so he “looked his last” with a broken and\nsatisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and\nthey all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift\nthem out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in\ntime, and made shift to avert it. About two o’clock in the morning the\nraft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,\nand they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part\nof the little raft’s belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they\nspread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions;\nbut they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as\nbecame outlaws.",
